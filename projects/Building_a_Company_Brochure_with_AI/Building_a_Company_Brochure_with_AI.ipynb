    "This project demonstrates how to create a company brochure using AI. By leveraging web scraping and OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini, we can efficiently gather information from a company's website and generate compelling content for prospective clients, investors, and potential recruits. This approach streamlines the brochure creation process, making it faster and more cost-effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The project involves scraping a company's website, identifying relevant links, and using the scraped content to automatically generate a brochure. We use Python for web scraping and data processing, and the OpenAI API to generate the brochure's content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Technologies\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Python**: The primary programming language used for web scraping, data processing, and interacting with the OpenAI API.\n",
    "* **Beautiful Soup**: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents, used here to extract information from web pages.\n",
    "* **OpenAI API**: Used to generate the brochure content, leveraging the GPT-4o-mini model for its natural language processing capabilities."

It implements fewer features than other frameworks -> that\\'s the feature.\\n\\n➡️ The main issue among agentic frameworks is complexity : they tend to pile up abstractions, trying to solve everything rather than bein part of a bigger workflow. So instead of making the all-encompassing factory, we set out to make the smallest possible framework for agents, the one that would just provide the essential building blocks and let users build the rest.\\n\\n💡 Optimizing for reducing size is interesting, because it forces you to consider simplicity at each step :\\n- do we need this abstraction, won\\'t it make the code less readable?\\n- instead of adding this feature, why shouldn\\'t we just provide the building blocks that will let users build it for themselves?\\n\\nGo try it out!
